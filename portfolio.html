      <h2 id="head-about">About me</h2>
        <h3 id="how-i-came">How I got here?</h3>
        <p id="explain">I am an English national who moved to Canada in October, 2022. I initially came to work in a <a id="camp" href="https://www.campwalden.ca/"> summer 
          camp</a> in 2021, then the following year I worked in the same summer camp and decided I knew I wanted to stay. I then worked in a <a id="robinhood" href="https://www.camprobinhood.ca/"> day camp in the fall.</a></p>
          <h3 id="how-i-came">My background:</h3>
          <p id="explain">I went to a <a id="school" href="https://thestudioliverpool.uk/">technology based high school</a>, this was my first introduction to programming and tought me about computers, why they are important and the things you can do if you know different programming languages.
          However, after high school, I pursued another passion of mine; law. I had dreamt of being a human rights lawyer since I visited Pakistan when I was a child. I did have a great passion for computers, which never left, I continued building, fixing and using computers. When I decided to move to Canada, I was still in law school but I knew 
        I wanted to be here and even though I was about to be in my final year, I decided to take the leap and move. In this venture, I started teaching myself HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python as a hobby, this allowed me to continue learning, albeit not law, but something else I was passionate about. After some time, I decided to look into bootcamp options since programming was something I was enjoying more and more which lead me to finding <a id="bootcamp" href="https://brainstation.io/">BrainStation</a> an intensive 12 week, fullstack course.</p>
